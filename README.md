# Personal Code Training Academy - PHP

Welcome to PeCoTa... I know, the name is so cool!

## What is this?

Just a simple repository for PHP stuff, algorithms, problems or you just fun. 

## The Rule

There is only ONE rule: All the code live here must have its test.

## How to run localy

The typical and boring steps:

1. Clone it: `git@github.com:juque/PeCoTa-PHP.git`
2. Install dependencies: `composer install`
3. Run tests: `./vendor/bin/phpunit`
